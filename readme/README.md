Hello,

Here is my first responsive website 😍

http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-Joana2617/

and the is // 👜 Style & Tech 💻 \\

A mini e-commerce web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches product data from the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/). Users can add or remove products from the shopping cart, and their cart is saved using `localStorage`.

My page can do:

- Search filter by product title
- Shopping cart with total price and quantity
- Buttons to "Buy" or "Remove" items
- Product list fetched dynamically from an API
- Cart data saved in `localStorage`

I used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- API (https://fakestoreapi.com/)

I hope you enjoy the page. 😊
